Overview
========

MNMLSTC Flyweight is a C++11 library that implements the Flyweight design
pattern. Unlike Boost.Flyweight, MNMLSTC Flyweight is threadsafe. While MNMLSTC
Flyweight offers the same features as Boost.Flyweight, it does so with a
different interface. This is because MNMLSTC Flyweight is not a drop in
replacement for Boost.Flyweight.

It is recommended that new users read the section on
:ref:`using-mnmlstc-flyweight`.
